# guided-journal-frontend

This is a journal application that I have created with a JS front end and Rails API for the backend. The app allows you to add and edit journal entries.

To run this application clone this repository down to your local device along with the Rails backend (https://github.com/rnkwilliams/guided-journal-api). While in the Rails backend run rails s to start the server. You can then open the index page in a browser and run the application like normal.

Enjoy!
